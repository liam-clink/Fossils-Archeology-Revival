Ankylosaurus, the "Fused Lizard,"
is a dinosaur that all tanks could 
take some notes from. At about six 
six meters long and over one meter 
tall, the ankylosaurus put every 
part of its hefty body to work in 
protecting itself. Its armor 
consisted of massive knobs and boney
plates embedded in the skin called
osteoderms. These osteoderms were 
light and sturdy, and they were
highly resistant to penetrative 
objects like the teeth of predators.
When it felt threatened, it employed 
its powerful tail club against other 
dinosaurs, oscillating its tail in
a hundred degree motion. The
placement of the club at the end of 
the tail adds to its inertia, 
causing massive damage to opponents.

The ankylosaurus lived in North
America during the late Cretaceous 
Period alongside fierce predators
and competition. Its incredible 
defense mechanisms protected it 
against massive carnivores like T.
rex. It occupied a similar niche 
to herbivores like triceratops, 
but it likely did not vie for 
resources with the other species of 
ankylosaurid that lived in the 
region. Its wide mouth allowed the 
ankylosaurus to feed on a variety 
of low vegetation, and as the 
largest known ankylosaurid, the
amount of food that passed through
its large digestive system would
have been immense.

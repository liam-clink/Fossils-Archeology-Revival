Tyrannosaurus rex, the "Tyrant 
Lizard King," is the most famous 
dinosaur in existence, being 
represented in art, literature,
entertainment, etc. With a 
maximum length at a whopping 
thirteen meters and a height of
over four meters, this creature
towered over humans and many other 
animals as well. Its growth started
and ended slowly, but tyrannosaurus 
experienced a growth spurt during 
its teenage years. The result was 
the giant creature known and loved 
today. However, like many other 
tyrannosaurs, tyrannosaurus died 
shortly after reaching maturity and
their infants often died naturally
in the volatile world of the 
Cretaceous. 

Living in the Maastrichtian age, 
just before the extinction of the 
dinosaurs in the Cretaceous, T. rex 
was among the last great non-avian 
dinosaurs to roam the Earth. In 
fact, it is the last known member of 
its family Tyrannosauridae. It lived 
across what is now North America in 
warm and humid climates alongside a 
plethora of herbivorous animals and 
small theropods. It commonly preyed 
upon famous herbivores such as
triceratops and edmontosaurus. Its 
hollow bones allowed it to move 
quickly and its robust, blade-like 
teeth permitted it to rip into prey, 
mutilating any allegations that it 
may be a simple scavenger.

Smilodon, the "Knife Tooth," is
commonly referred to as the saber-
toothed tiger despite its very 
distant relations to tigers. It was
a very robust feline, with the 
largest species (Smilodon populator)
weighing in at a whopping four
hundred kilograms. It stood around
one hundred and twenty centimeters 
tall, which is comparable to the
height of a tiger. Its iconic 
canines were 28 centimeters long
and relatively fragile; they could
not be used to take down prey, but
were rather used to deliver the 
killing bite to the throat. This,
and the fact that their powerful
bodies were built for jumping, makes
smilodon into a highly efficient 
killing machine.

All species of smilodon lived in the
Pleistocene epoch, covering a 
territory that stretched from North 
to South America. They likely hunted
in packs, working together to bring 
down large mammals in forest and
bush environments. Their proficiency 
in jumping means that they may have 
been ambush predators like many 
modern big cats. However, although 
apex predators, smilodon faced 
several threats. Ravenous cave lions 
and dire wolves competed with 
smilodon for the same resources, and 
confrontations were certain. They
also fell victim to the infamous tar 
pits, such as the ones in La Brea,
California.
